#A Nolim HD / Cybook Muse ebooks 'SDK'

More than an SDK, is just a bunch of funcs letting you to update
the ebook's framebuffer to the eink display, and read the touch data
from '/dev/cyio'.

All the functions are inside 'eink_lib.h', including the .h is just enought for 
start working.

The 'main.c' sample is a simple touch numpad working on top of DirectFB and
using the eink_lib.

For compiling the sample use the Makefile in the repository. You will need to
install the arm toolchain on your desired linux 
(arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc will be ok)

Dependencies are
	- DirectFB 2.11
	- libfusion
	- libdirect
	- libz

Those libs are in the ebook /usr/lib linux folder, some 'SCP' commands will
let you to download the libs to link with them. (Just copy them inside the 'libs' folder)
